# Requirements for tools used in the development of tornado.
# This list is for python 3.5; for 2.7 add:
# - backports.ssl-match-hostname
# - futures
# - mock
# - certifi
#
# Use virtualenv instead of venv; tox seems to get confused otherwise.
#

# indirect dependencies; this file only contains direct dependencies
# and is useful for upgrading.
